Computer System
  1.  Consists of a number of interrelated components that work
      together with the aim of converting data into information.
  2.  Process iss carried out electronically, usually with little
      little or no intervention from a human user.

Three Basic Categories of Computer
  1.  Mainframe
        Powerful computers used for large-scale data processing.
        A moderna personal computer could be considered many times
        more powerful than one of the very earliest mainframe systems.
  2.  Minicomputer
        Combines some of the characteristics of the mainframe
        computer and microcomputer. Today they are often referred to
        as servers by computers.


Hey Mr Kumar, for the assignment would it be okay to 
talk about Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling as a
new system. It uses AI rendering to render at a lower
resolution and artifically upscale to a higher resolution,
resulting in huge performance improvements especially in
real-time rendering applications.

Definition: DLSS is a deep learning neural network that uses the 
            power of the NVIDIA RTX TensorCores to boost frame rates
            and generate sharp frames that approach or exceed native
            rendering.

So I would like to bring this relatively new technology
which is currently a work-in-progress for games and game development
to the video and photo editing industy like Adobe Premiere, after-effects
and photoshop. Since this works with RTX GPUs that support ray-tracing,
video lighting and photo lighting rendering can also be hugely improved
and render times can be sped up by a huge amount.



1.  The main components are as follows:
    1.  input
          used to enter data, information or instructions
          into a computer-based information system
    2.  cpu
          controls all of the computerâ€™s main functions and enables
          users to execute programs or process data
    3.  memory
          temporary means of storing data awaiting processing, instructions 
          used to process data or control the computer system, and data 
          or information that has been processed
    4.  storage
          permanent means of storing data and programs until they are required
    5.  output
          translate info-processing-output into human readable form

2.  Basic Categories are:
    1.  Mainframe
          super computers that process large-scale data
    2.  Minicomputer
          known as servers, which can be used to manage networks
          host a database
    3.  Microcomputer
          client machine that provides powerful computing at low cost

3.  Types of microcomputers:
    1.  Desktop computers
    2.  Portable computers

4.  Types of input devices include keyboard, mouse , touch screen,
    capture cards and sound cards.

5.  Types of Output devices include monitor, speaker and printer

6.  CPU fetches instructions from software loaded into memory, decodes
    then executes those instructions. The arithmetic logic unit of the CPU
    does mathematical operations
7.  Basic Categories of System Software:
    1.  Operating Systems
    2.  Development Programs
    3.  Utility Programs

8.  Operating system monitors and sends instructions to manage
    computer resources

9.  Development program allows user to use programming language
    to make their own software

10. Utility programs provide tools to support operation and
    management of coputer. Examples are task manager and windows defender.
