Why relational data model?

The relational model is based on the mathematical concept of a relation,
which is physically represented as a table.

Types of keys
  Super key
    attribute that uniquely identifies a row in a table
  Candidate key
    super key with minimal set of attributes; possible primary key
  Primary key
    attribute taht uniquely identifies each row in a table
  Alternate key
    the candidate keys that are not selected to be the primary key
  Composite key
    a key that has more than one attribute
  Foreign key
    an attribute (or set of attributes)
    
    
    
Entity Integrity rule
  Primary key in base relations must not contain any nulls 
  (same applies for composite keys)

Referential Integrity rule
  foreign key values must match a primary key value of some tuple in the
  in the home relation or be wholly null.

General constraints
  Additional rules specified by the users or database administrators that
  define or constrain some aspect of the enterprise.
