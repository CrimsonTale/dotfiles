What is data?
  Info in raw/unorganised form

Database
  Shared collection of logically related data and its description

Why is database important?
  Allows us to organize,store and retrieve data according to our individual needs.

How was data stored in the past?
  Flat files 

Files based approach
  (apps used file-based approach-
  Program code
  (data definition, file handling routines, business logic)
  )

Limitations
  Separation and isolation of data
    each program maintains its own set of data(not centrally located...harded to access)

  Duplication of data
    uncontrolled duplication(more $, more space, loss of data integrity as less consistent)

  Data dependence
    file structure defined in code(hard to change file structure)
  
  Incompatible file formats
    different programming languages

  Fixed queries/proliferation of programs


Solution
  Database approach via DBMS

What is DBMS?
  Software system to define,create,maintain and control access to database
  DBMS is the gateway between application program and database

Enterprise Database Systems


File-based vs DB
  data vs data+metadata
  each program manage own data vs shared by many programs
  
The 5 components of DBMS
  1. Machines(Hardware,Software)
  2. Bridge(data + metadata)
  3. Human(Procedures,People)

Advantages of DBMS
  control of data reduncancy
  data consistency
  sharing of data
  improved data integrity
  improved security
  
Disadvantages of DBMS
  complexity
  size
  cost of DBMS
  cost of additional hardware
  cost of conversion
  
Roles
  data admin
  database admin
  database designer
  develop
  end user
